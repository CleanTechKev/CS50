CS is the process of [input -> problem solving -> output]

Humans communicate with numbers, and specifically numeric symbols
- computers must use ones and zeros
- this is binary
- it uses base 2 instead of base 10 (only two digits)

So to write the number 50, and computer writes:
- 110010 or 32+16+2

We can use pre-determined patterns or mapping
- this is known as ASCII
- the letter "A" is the number 65, B is 66 in ASCII
- Unicode is similar but uses more bits to describe things like emoji

Another example is Red Green Blue (RGB)
- numbers tell computer how much RGB to display
- e.g. 72 73 33 = yellow

All of these inputs and outputs can be reduced to 1s and 0s
- these encodings are similar to sheet music, for example

Bringing us to algorithms
- step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

Writing in languages
- functions tell the computer what to do
- conditions are branches or forks (decision points)
- questions are boolean expressions (Y/N or T/F or 1/0 answers)
- loops are cycles that repeat
- variables can be stored

Programming Language example:
- scratch.mit.edu
